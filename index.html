											<h2>About the project</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Hello! My name is Cassian La Bounty. <br> I'm a senior BFA Graphic Design student at Illinois State University</p>
										<p>I've been investigating the topic of happiness, such as different forms it can take and how it affects our lives. The goal of my research is to create awareness of how much happiness impacts each and every one of us. Through this project I'm hoping to open the discussion of what happiness is, the different forms it can take, and what happiness looks like to different people.</p>

										<h2>Research</h2>
									</header>
									<p>There was a ton of research behind the scenes for this project. It was difficult to know where to begin, seeing as the topic can be so broad. I began by looking up definitions of happiness, and one interpretation that I found that I thought explained it well came from <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-happiness-4869755"> verywellmind.com</a> stating: <br><br> "Happiness is an emotional state characterized by feelings of joy, satisfaction, contentment, and fulfillment; often described as involving positive emotions and life satisfaction."<br> <br>Verywellmind broke happiness down into two key components: <b>The balance of emotions</b> (Everyone experiences both positive and negative emotions, feelings, and moods. Happiness is generally linked to experiencing more positive feelings than negative.) and <b>life satisfaction</b> (This relates to how satisfied you feel with different areas of your life including your relationships, work, achievements, and other things that you consider important.) </p>
									<p> Some <b>key signs of happiness</b> include: <br>

										Feeling like you are living the life you wanted <br>
										Feeling that the conditions of your life are good <br>
										Feeing that you have accomplished (or will accomplish) what you want in life <br>
										Feeling satisfied with your life <br>
										Feeling positive more than negative <br>
									</p>

									<p>Something that verywellmind mentioned that stuck with me was "One important thing to remember is that happiness isn't a state of constant euphoria. Instead, happiness is an overall sense of experiencing more positive emotions than negative ones."</p>
									<p>Aristotle made a distinction between two different kinds of happiness: hedonia and eudaimonia. <br>
										<b>Hedonia</b>: Hedonic happiness is derived from pleasure. It is most often associated with doing what feels good, self-care, fulfilling desires, experiencing enjoyment, and feeling a sense of satisfaction.<br>
										<b>Eudaimonia</b>: This type of happiness is derived from seeking virtue and meaning. Important components of eudaimonic well-being including feeling that your life has meaning, value, and purpose. It is associated more with fulfilling responsibilities, investing in long-term goals, concern for the welfare of other people, and living up to personal ideals.
										more commonly known today in psychology as pleasure and meaning.
									</p>

									<p>Some <b>types of happiness</b> include:<br>
										<b>Joy</b>: A often relatively brief feeling that is felt in the present moment<br>
										<b>Excitement</b>: A happy feeling that involves looking forward to something with positive anticipation<br>
										<b>Gratitude</b>: A positive emotion that involves being thankful and appreciative<br>
										<b>Pride</b>: A feeling of satisfaction in something that you have accomplished<br>
										<b>Optimism</b>: This is a way of looking at life with a positive, upbeat outlook<br>
										<b>Contentment</b>: This type of happiness involves a sense of satisfaction<br>
									</p>

									<p>Ways to <b>cultivate happiness</b>: <br>
										<b>Intrinsic motivation</b> refers to behavior that is driven by internal rewards. In other words, the motivation to engage in a behavior arises from within the individual because it is naturally satisfying to you. This contrasts with <b>extrinsic motivation</b>, which involves engaging in a behavior in order to earn external rewards or avoid punishment. <br>
										Enjoying the moment, avoiding accumulating things to endlessly make you happy, finding gratitude in what you have and enjoying the process. <br>
										Reframing negative thoughts and emotions in a new light. Not ignoring the problem, but gaining a balanced and realistic look
									</p>

									<p><b>Impacts</b> of happiness: <br>
										- Positive emotions increase satisfaction with life. <br>
										- Happiness helps people build stronger coping skills and emotional resources. <br>
										- Positive emotions are linked to better health and longevity. One study found that people who experienced more positive emotions than negative ones were more likely to have survived over a 13 year period. <i>(Carstensen LL, Turan B, Scheibe S, et al. Emotional experience improves with age: evidence based on over 10 years of experience sampling. Psychol Aging. 2011;26(1):21‐33. doi:10.1037/a0021285)</i> <br>
										- Positive feelings increase resilience. Resilience helps people better manage stress and bounce back better when faced with setbacks. For example, one study found that happier people tend to have lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol and that these benefits tend to persist over time. <i>(Steptoe A, Wardle J. Positive affect and biological function in everyday life. Neurobiol Aging. 2005;26 Suppl 1:108‐112. doi:10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2005.08.016)</i> <br>
										- People who report having a positive state of well-being are more likely to engage in healthy behaviors such as eating fruits and vegetables and engaging in regular physical exercise. <i>(Sapranaviciute-Zabazlajeva L, Luksiene D, Virviciute D, Bobak M, Tamosiunas A. Link between healthy lifestyle and psychological well-being in Lithuanian adults aged 45-72: a cross-sectional study. BMJ Open. 2017;7(4):e014240. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2016-014240)</i> <br>
										- Being happy may help you get sick less often. Happier mental states are linked to increased immunity. <i>(Costanzo ES, Lutgendorf SK, Kohut ML, et al. Mood and cytokine response to influenza virus in older adults. J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci. 2004;59(12):1328‐1333. doi:10.1093/gerona/59.12.1328)</i>
									</p>

									<p><b>Improving</b> happiness <br>
										- Exercise <br>
										- Finding purpose in life <br>
										- In one study, participants were asked to engage in a writing exercise for 10 to 20 minutes each night before bed. <i>(Cunha LF, Pellanda LC, Reppold CT. Positive psychology and gratitude interventions: a randomized clinical trial. Front Psychol. 2019;10:584. Published 2019 Mar 21. doi:10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00584).</i> <br>
										- The results found that people who had written about gratitude had increased positive emotions, increased subjective happiness, and improved life satisfaction.

									</p>

									<p><b>Challenges</b> finding happiness<br>
										<b>Valuing wrong things</b> - study found that spending money on things that buy time, such as spending money on time-saving services, can increase happiness and life satisfaction. <i>(Whillans AV, Dunn EW, Smeets P, Bekkers R, Norton MI. Buying time promotes happiness. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2017;114(32):8523‐8527. doi:10.1073/pnas.1706541114) </i> <br>
										<b>Not valuing social support</b> - one study found that perceptions of social support were responsible for 43% of a person's level of happiness. <i>(Gulacti F. The effect of perceived social support on subjective well-being. Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences. 2010;2(2):3844-3849. doi:10.1016/j.sbspro.2010.03.602) </i> <br>
										<b>Thinking of happiness as an endpoint</b> - One study found that people who tend to value happiness most also tended to feel the least satisfied with their lives. <i>(Mauss IB, Tamir M, Anderson CL, Savino NS. Can seeking happiness make people unhappy? [corrected] Paradoxical effects of valuing happiness [published correction appears in Emotion. 2011 Aug;11(4):767]. Emotion. 2011;11(4):807‐815. doi:10.1037/a0022010)</i> <br>

									<p>According to an article written by Courtney E. Ackerman for  <a href="https://positivepsychology.com/what-is-happiness/"> positivepsychology.com</a>,
										"Happiness is a more stable state than pleasure. <b>Happiness</b> is a state characterized by feelings of contentment and satisfaction with one’s life or current situation. <b>Pleasure</b> is a more visceral, in-the-moment experience. It often refers to the sensory-based feelings we get from experiences like eating good food, getting a massage, receiving a compliment, or having sex."<br>
										Unlike happiness, <b>meaning</b> is not a fleeting state that drifts throughout the day; it’s a more comprehensive sense of purpose and feeling of contributing to something greater than yourself.
									</p>

									<p>
										Scott Barry Kaufman at Scientific American (2016) outlines these distinctions that researchers found between happiness and meaning:<br>

   										- Finding one’s life easy or difficult was related to happiness, but not meaning;<br>
    									- Feeling healthy was related to happiness, but not meaning;<br>
    									- Feeling good was related to happiness, not meaning;<br>
    									- Scarcity of money reduced happiness more than meaning;<br>
    									- People with more meaningful lives agreed that “relationships are more important than achievements;”<br>
    									- Helping people in need was linked to meaning but not happiness;<br>
    									- Expecting to do a lot of deep thinking was positively related to meaningfulness, but negatively with happiness;<br>
    									- Happiness was related more to being a taker rather than a giver, whereas meaning was related more to being a giver than a taker;<br>
    									- The more people felt their activities were consistent with the core themes and values of their self, the greater meaning they reported in their activities;<br>
    									- Seeing oneself as wise, creative, and even anxious were all linked to meaning but had no relationship (and in some cases, even showed a negative relationship) to happiness (Kaufman, 2016).<br>

									</p>

									<p>
										<b>Self-happiness</b> is being happy/content with yourself, good self-esteem, self-confidence, being pleased with your actions and choices.
									</p>

									<p>
										Ackerman mentions that while there are many theories regarding happiness, they all tend to agree on a few points:<br>
										- It’s good to be happy, and people like being happy; <br>
										- Happiness is neither a totally fleeting, momentary experience nor a stable, long-term trait; <br>
										- At least some portion of our happiness is set by our genetics, but the amount varies from about 10% up to 50%; <br>
										- The pursuit and attainment of pleasure will rarely lead to happiness; <br>
										- There are many sources that contribute to or compose happiness. <br>

									</p>

									<p>
										In an article written by <a href="https://www.aipc.net.au/articles/happiness-and-positive-psychology/">AIPC</a> happiness and positive psychology are discussed as the primary focus being on  "what people do right to obtain and maintain optimum happiness, by striving to understand and help people develop qualities that lead to greater personal fulfilment. The premise of positive psychology is to promote factors that allow individuals to thrive and flourish by encouraging a change of focus in psychology from a preoccupation with repairing the worst things to a greater emphasis on discovering and building upon positive qualities." <br>
										I thought this was interesting because it looks at the more psychological aspect of happiness, and tries to understand what people are looking for that will help to lead themselves to personal fulfillment. <br>
										
									</p>

									<p>
										According to Ackerman, there are several factors that can impact one's happiness: <br>
										- Individual income; <br>
										- Labor market status; <br>
										- Physical health;<br>
										- Family;<br>
										- Social relationships;<br>
										- Moral values;<br>
										- Experience of positive emotions<br>

									</p>

									<p>
										A large portion of my project is focused on helping people to understand that happiness can come in many forms, and that people don't have to copy what makes other people happy in order to obtain happiness for themselves. I think that a lot of this research and the case studies help to reinforce that claim, and can serve as a starting point when diving into such a deep topic.

										<h2>Survey</h2>
									</header>
									<p>I wnted to make sure that the survey was simple, asked little of the viewer, and took a small amount of time to complete. I figured that this was the best way for me to actually get answers, especially when sharing through social media. Personally, I don't mind doing surveys for people but when I open the survey and it's going to take me over half an hour to complete, I don't want to do it.</p>
									<p>I wanted to make sure that people were comfortable with what they were sharing and what they were being asked. I made sure to mention that everything was entirely optional, and that the viewer could go into as much detail or as little as they chose. It felt almost "corporate" to include the statement saying that the answers provided may be shared in a public space, but I didn't want to hide it from anyone. I figured it was better in than out.</p>

									<h2>Social Media</h2>
									<p>Once the survey was created, I had to come up with a way to get it into circulation. These images are the posts that I created for social media. </p>
								</header>
								<ul class="statistics">
									<li class="style1">
										<span class="image helpme"><img src="images/Happiness Story-01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										<strong>Snapchat</strong> 
									</li>
									<li class="style2">
										<span class="image helpme"><img src="images/Happiness Story-02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										<strong>Instagram</strong>
									</li>
									
								</ul>
								<p class="content">I wanted to introduce the survey to viewers in a way that wasn't too invasive. I didn't want to pressure anyone into taking the survey or start forcing it on people. I ended up using Instagram and Snapchat as a way to provide the link to people. I designed these two posts as a way to give a small amount of information while also being able to cover parts of it with links or different messages. I used the story feature on both apps, which allows the viewer to choose whether or not they want to see the post. They're also only up for 24 hours at a time, so it wouldn't flood everyone's feeds. The only downside to this method of delivery is me not having a lot of people added on social media, so the reach isn't as big as I'd like. I figured one way to solve this issue was to ask users to share the survey with others if they'd like to help expand the project. Doing that gave me a larger amount of responses actually, so I'm curious to see how much traffic this website gets.</p>

											<h2>Poster</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Once I had a good amount of answers recorded in the survey, I wanted to make a data visualization from the information. At first I was going to showcase all of the different things people talked about and the age range that I had gotten, but I didn't want to make a visualization that had a lot of words or info on it. Ultimately I decided to make a pictograph based on the most recurring themes in the answers.</p>
										<p>Honestly, making the poster was extremely difficult. I had a lot of issues with planning it and making sure everything was working correctly. Time and money were also getting to be an issue towards the end.</p>
										<span class="image"><img src="images/IMG_1722.JPG" alt="" /></span>
										<p>These are the early sketches of the icons that I wanted to use. I had to make sure that they would work as a negative space so it took some planning to make sure everything would line up and still have some structure. In the earliest part of making it I was trying to cut out each individual icon out of one piece of material. Long story short, it was impossible. I was pulling my hair out trying to cut each icon perfectly and if I messed up at all the entire poster was shot and I had to restart. </p>
										<span class="image"><img src="images/posterproto.JPG" alt="" /></span>
										<p>This is the early prototype of the entire frame with the lights and the cellophane behind it. It looks a bit wonky because I didn't want to commit to anything at the time, so it's kinda just floating in the frame.</p>
										<span class="image"><img src="images/posteron.JPG" alt="" /></span>
										<p>Here's a picture of me turning it on when it was finally done! I had to fiddle with it because the center was super dark due to a material that I had in the back of the frame absorbing all of the light.</p>

									<p>For the last part of the project I really wanted to do something interactive since it was going to be done around the time of the show. I had talked about using UV reactive ink as part of my materials for the other projects, and someone mentioned that it would be cool to use it for this idea. The goal of it is to allow the audience to connect with the work and to "find" things that make other people happy. I had a lot of fun setting up the wall and getting the materials for it because I really enjoy blacklight work, so in my opinion it turned out really great and I can't wait to try and take a picture of the entire wall with everyone's messages on it. </p>
